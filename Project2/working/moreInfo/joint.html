        <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The discovery of exoplanets can bring about many questions and curiosities, 
          We have included two tables to help satisfy these.&ensp;Our Glossary provides a brief description of some 
          key terms and a link for those interested in a more in depth explanation.&ensp;The Further Information 
          table provides a variety of videos, categorized from 1 to 3, where 1 is the least technical and 3 the most.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Our hope is that you use some of these links as a starting point to help 
          further your understanding of this incomprehensible reality we live in known as the universe.&ensp;What 
          lies beyond our solar system and our galaxy?&ensp;Is there any other life out there?&ensp;Is any of it 
          intelligent?&ensp;How can we possibly traverse such inconceivable distances to find out?&ensp;
          The earth will not remain habitable forever and if we wish to persist as a species, we will need to 
          figure all these things out.
