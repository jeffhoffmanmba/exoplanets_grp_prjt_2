          <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The discovery of exoplanets can bring about many questions and curiosities, 
            to help satisfy these we present Further Information.&ensp;While our glossary provides links to guide 
            you on your way down a rabbit hole of research, Further Information is an excellent source of videos to gain 
            various levels of understanding when it comes to exoplanets and the continuation of the human race.
            &ensp;The videos are categorized from 1 to 3, where 1 is the least technical and 3 the most.
            &ensp;At the bottom you will find youtube channels which contain some truly amazing videos that will surely
            enlighten you to things you may never have considered (if they do not open for you, please cut and paste the 
            address into a browser window).
          </p>
          <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Our hope is that you use some of these links as a starting point to help 
            further your understanding of this incomprehensible reality we live in known as the universe.&ensp;What 
            lies beyond our solar system and our galaxy?&ensp;Is there any other life out there?&ensp;Is any of it 
            intelligent?&ensp;How can we possibly traverse such inconceivable distances to find out?&ensp;
            The earth will not remain habitable forever and if we wish to persist as a species, we will need to 
            figure all these things out.
