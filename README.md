# Potentially Inhabitable Exoplanets - Group Project Team 5

Potentially Inhabitable Exo-planets    (group 5)
    For hundreds of millions of years creatures have roamed this planet looking at
the night sky, at the distant points of light.  It is most likely that until very recently
none of these creatures were concerned with what else there was beyond their
ecosystem, where such a place might exist, and are there other life forms there?
    There are currently over 4000 known planets in the visible universe, each
existing for billions of years.  At some point, somewhere, other life must have
evolved, but as of now we have found no such evidence.  What we do have is
information on the size and density of these known planets, how far from their host
star(s) they orbit, and how much energy their star(s) emit.  From this we can
extrapolate a likely temperature of each planet.  Since, from what we know, life
needs liquid water to propagate and thrive, we can assume that life on other
planets would only be possible if they held liquid water.
    Just like goldilocks (who felt it appropriate to enter a stranger’s house and eat
their food) had three bowls of oatmeal, with somehow very varying temperatures,
water exists in three forms; steam (too hot), ice(too cold), and liquid water (just
right).  Any planet with a temperature between 0 and 100 degrees centigrade has
the possibility of having liquid water and therefor the possibility of life.  Such
planets exist in  “habitable zone” (aka “goldilocks zone”).
    We will be providing some (hopefully) spectacular graphs depicting information
about exoplanets that may be capable of hosting life, including their size, density,
temperature, composition, solar system data, galactic locations and distance from
earth.
