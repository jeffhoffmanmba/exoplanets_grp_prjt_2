# Group Project - VisualizeMeCaptain - Potentially Inhabitable Exoplanets!

## Background

For hundreds of millions of years creatures have roamed our planet looking at
the night sky, at the distant points of light. At some point, somewhere, other life must have
evolved, but as of now we have found no such evidence.  

There are currently over 4000 known planets in the visible universe, each
existing for billions of years.

## What's Known about the 4000+ planets discovered?

NASA and astronmers have collected information on the size and density of these 4000+ known planets, 
how far from their host star(s) they orbit, and how much energy their star(s) emit.  From this
a likely temperature of each planet can be extrapolated. Since, from what we know, life
needs liquid water to propagate and thrive, we can assume that life on other
planets would only be possible if they held liquid water.

To find another planet like Earth, astronomers are focusing on the 'habitable zone' around 
stars--where it's not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface. Any planet with a 
temperature between 0 and 100 degrees centigrade has
the possibility of having liquid water and therefor the possibility of life.  Such
planets exist in a “habitable zone” (aka “goldilocks zone”).

## Your Task

* Your task is to tell a story through data visualizations. Focus on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves. 
Prepare a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization

We will be providing graphs depicting information about the exoplanets that may be capable of hosting life, including their size, density,
temperature, composition, solar system data, galactic locations and distance from earth. As well as a leaflet on the facilities discovering 
these exoplanets.

It is most likely that until very recently none of Earths creatures were concerned with what else there was beyond their
ecosystem, where such a place might exist, and are there other life forms there?

* 1.Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
* 2.Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks: 
	○ A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart) 
	○ A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly 
	○ A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data 
	○ A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved) 
* 3.Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover. 
* 4.Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records. 
* 5.Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes). 
* 6.Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

“If we can identify another Earth-like planet, it comes full circle, from thinking that everything revolves around our planet to 
knowing that there are lots of other Earths out there.” Sara Seager, professor of planetary science and physics at MIT
