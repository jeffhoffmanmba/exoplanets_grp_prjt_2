1. As shown by the Leaflet, Observatories are located across the world.  It is a global effort.
2. As shown in the d3, of the 200 optimistic habitable planets, most have planet mass estimate below 1000 
and planet star distance (parsecs) below 1000
3. As shown in the d3, of the 200 optimistic habitable planets, overall there is less of a correlation between
Planet Radius Estimate and Planet Star Distance (parsecs)
4.  There are 2 main types of Planet Types discovered - Jovian (1302 or 32.3%) and SuperTerran (1099 or 27.27%)
